# Automated White Blood Cell Classification Using CNNs 

_A clinical decision-support prototype for first-pass WBC differentials from peripheral blood smear images._

## 1) Clinical motivation

Manual white blood cell (WBC) differentials are time-consuming and can be affected by fatigue, workload, and inter-observer variability—especially in high-throughput laboratory settings. This project explores a deployable deep learning pipeline that provides consistent first-pass WBC classification with a built-in human-review workflow for uncertain predictions.

Intended use (prototype): assistive triage and rapid first-pass differentials.
Not intended for: autonomous diagnosis, replacing technologist review, or use without site-specific validation.
